        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Altschool ID;</strong> ALT/SOE/0244/1265 </p>
        <p>I'm Judith Chukwuekwu Nwenearizi and i'm currently enrolled in the School of Engineering at Altschool Africa. I have always been passionate about technoology which led me to take this course. I graduated from Babcock University in 2023, studied Public Administration. Some may be wondering how tech relates to my course of study, well the world revolves. I recall wanting to join the science class in secondary school, but I chose not to because my sister switched from science to humanities. Even though she's really smart, why do you think she avoided the science class? Exactly, it was difficult for her, so I figured if she couldn't handle it, then I wouldn't be able to either.</p>
        <p>I joined Altschool to gain practical skills and industry knowledge that will help me excel in my career. The school of engineering program offers a comprehensive curriculum that aligns perfectly with my goals, providing hands-on experience in areas like frontend and backend engineering, cloud engineering and cybersecurity.</p>
